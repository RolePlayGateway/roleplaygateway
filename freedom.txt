Hi, my name is Eric Martindale and I own this website. I no longer wish to
stay Anonymous in the fight against internet censorship and those who want to
close down our internet.

An open internet is more important than the interests of nation states or
imaginary borders.  As with all increases in the bandwidth of information
transferred throughout the course of history, they begin with the innovator.

Inderpreet Singh will also link to other people supporting an open internet!
