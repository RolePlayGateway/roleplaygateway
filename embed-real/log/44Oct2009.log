Hope to leave her for a real short time tomorrow cause I really need some things at store (bread,toilet paper and milk to name a few). She probably dosen't care as long as I have dog food. I've been sleeping on the couch with her so she wouldn't try to jump up on my bed cause its higher. Dr. didn't want her to jump for a few days--good luck with that!!! I think summer has finally arrived in Maine--been real hot lately. I wouldn't dare complain because I sure did when all we got was rain for days and days. See you soon ******"[/color]

Aug 17 21:38:22 <Parabola> [color=navy]No Moniker, thats why he looks so old[/color]
Aug 17 21:38:22 <AzricanRepublic> Yes, Moniker. I created it. .-.

Aug 17 21:39:17 <AzricanRepublic> Yuz.
Aug 17 21:39:17 <Moniker> I suppose they did use lead based face paint, so why not?

Aug 17 21:39:33 * AzricanRepublic /me was an Indian in the 1800's.
Aug 17 21:39:34 <Elle> [color=black]Today, I learned that because of my new medication, I can either prevent malaria, or have a male yeast infection. I'm stuck in Africa for the next two months, and have to sit down to pee because I don't want to irritate my penis by touching it. FML[/color]

Aug 17 21:39:43 <Moniker> Depends WHICH day, Padabola. He's had a few.
Aug 17 21:39:45 * AzricanRepublic /me was a Crusader, and a Muslim swordsman.

Aug 17 21:40:31 <Parabola> [color=navy]I didn't think they allowed Muslims to be crusaders[/color]
Aug 17 21:40:34 <Pseudosyne> [color=maroon]Az writes encyclopedias for fun.[/color]
Aug 17 21:40:39 <AzricanRepublic> And to be a dick.
Aug 17 21:40:39 <Pseudosyne> [color=maroon]He has enough knowledge, anyway.[/color]
Aug 17 21:40:47 <AzricanRepublic> History actually happened [i]far[/i] differetly.
Aug 17 21:40:49 <AzricanRepublic> differently.*
Aug 17 21:41:04 <Moniker> How so?
Aug 17 21:41:12 <AzricanRepublic> I actually caused the attack on Pearl Harbor.
Aug 17 21:41:21 <AzricanRepublic> I beat Tojo in a game of poker.
Aug 17 21:41:26 <AzricanRepublic> And he lost the bet.

Aug 17 21:41:57 <Pseudosyne> [color=maroon]But he was in the john.[/color]

Aug 17 21:42:02 <Pseudosyne> [color=maroon]So they went on without him.[/color]
Aug 17 21:42:04 <Parabola> [color=navy]And the film would have been a lot less emotional[/color]
Aug 17 21:42:07 <AzricanRepublic> Yea.
Aug 17 21:42:08 <AzricanRepublic> ._.
Aug 17 21:42:12 <Moniker> Az was involved in Operation Valkyrie. He was the fellow with the wee little mustache.

Aug 17 21:49:33 <GourmetItalia> [color=black]Jokes are just jokes[/color]
Aug 17 21:49:35 <AzricanRepublic> The bastards are useless and all they do is poop.
Aug 17 21:49:36 <Elle> [color=black]...GourmetGenitalia?[/color]
Aug 17 21:49:36 <Pseudosyne> [color=maroon]And many times, they invite spamming.[/color]
Aug 17 21:49:37 <AzricanRepublic> >=C
Aug 17 21:49:40 <Elle> [color=black]Now, that's being offensive.[/color]
Aug 17 21:49:45 <Dino> [color=teal]Uhhh huh.[/color]
Aug 17 21:49:50 <GourmetItalia> [color=black]I never meant them for anything[/color]
Aug 17 21:50:02 <Moniker> Gourmet, help us kill a dragon: http://www.roleplaygateway.com/kill-dragon-ooc-t27441.html
Aug 17 21:50:06 <Parabola> [color=navy]It's how I first misread his/her name, so it's not really meant in a mean manner.[/color]
Aug 17 21:50:07 <GourmetItalia> [color=black]Or being spam oriented, I just wanted to see how many people were catching their attention[/color]
Aug 17 21:50:13 <GourmetItalia> [color=black]Hmm ... it's tempting Moniker[/color]
Aug 17 21:50:18 <Pseudosyne> [color=maroon]I don't get on people's case for fake whispering once in a while.[/color]
Aug 17 21:50:21 <Moniker> Do eet.
Aug 17 21:50:31 <Moniker> We haven't started on the quest yet, so there's still time!
Aug 17 21:50:36 * Dino /me [color=teal]has the urge to perform a karate chop...[/color]
Aug 17 21:50:53 * Dino /me [color=teal]...or a Samoan Swat Kick....[/color]
Aug 17 21:51:01 <Moniker> Did he at least do a good fake whisper, like 'what are you wearing?' or somesuch?
Aug 17 21:51:02 <Elle> [color=black]Today, we had to run a mile in class. I needed to run it in at least 10 minutes to pass, which was going to be hard for me seeing as I'm an extremely slow runner. I pretended dementors were chasing me while screaming EXPECTO PATRONUM. I ran it in 6 minutes. MLIA

Aug 17 21:52:15 <GourmetItalia> [color=black]Yes it happened sometime last month after doing fake whispering for small periods of time, you told me that I it had to stop; quite harsh on your part[/color]
Aug 17 21:52:26 <Moniker> Pfft.
Aug 17 21:52:32 <Moniker> Pseu's just naturally a hard-ass.
Aug 17 21:52:35 <Pseudosyne> [color=maroon]Well, if you have a problem with my moderation, tell me in whispers.[/color]
Aug 17 21:52:38 <Moniker> He won't even let me RP as a rapist.
Aug 17 21:52:41 <Parabola> [color=navy]I'm going to make a character on that roleplay. Who is deluded into thinking they are a princess. But is actually just a merchant's daughter with some fancy clothes.[/color]

Aug 17 21:55:19 <Elle> [color=black]Today, as my girlfriend was dropping me home, our goodbye kiss got kind of heavy. Still parked in my drive, we had fast, frenzied sex. After, we realised that she had never put the hand brake on and that we had rolled down my drive, blocking my dad who was patiently waiting to pull in. FML[/color]

Aug 17 21:56:39 <PanDzieciak> [color=black]Pseudosyne[/color]
Aug 17 21:56:43 <PanDzieciak> [color=black]I was thinking of adding an FML[/color]
Aug 17 21:56:44 <Dino> [color=teal]You did what to who?![/color]
Aug 17 21:56:46 <Elle> [color=black]And... I was with my friend.[/color]

Aug 17 21:57:39 <Elle> [color=black]"You know, I'd love you the same if you were a lesbian."[/color]
Aug 17 21:57:44 <Elle> [color=black]WOMAN, this was a few years ago.[/color]

Aug 17 21:58:29 <Pseudosyne> [color=maroon]Pan, that might not be right for FML. :D[/color]
Aug 17 21:58:29 <Dino> [color=teal]My dad doesn't even know I've reached puberty yet.[/color]
Aug 17 21:58:37 <Dino> [color=teal]I'm careful not to tip him off.[/color]
Aug 17 21:58:40 <PanDzieciak> [color=black]It's a pretty FML moment I was thinking.[/color]
Aug 17 21:58:48 <Pseudosyne> [color=maroon]As the point of FML is to give apathetic college students a chance to be ironic.[/color]
Aug 17 21:59:02 <Pseudosyne> [color=maroon]And share how their life sucks when it doesn't really in any way.[/color]
Aug 17 21:59:20 <Elle> [color=black]Today, I took a quiz on facebook telling me what age I was going to die at. It said 13. I am 15. I feel like I have cheated death. MLIA [/color]
Aug 17 21:59:35 <Pseudosyne> [color=maroon]I feel MLIA is much more realistic. :)[/color]
Aug 17 21:59:48 <Parabola> [color=navy]Someone takes Facebook quizzes too seriously[/color]
Aug 17 22:00:16 <PanDzieciak> [color=black]What's MLIA[/color]

Aug 17 22:00:33 <PanDzieciak> [color=black]Ooh[/color]
Aug 17 22:00:38 <Pseudosyne> [color=maroon]It's like FML, but less hipster, I'd say.[/color]
Aug 17 22:00:39 <Dino> [color=teal]Today, I went to a local coffee shop and ordered a mocha and a doughnut. When she asked me what kind of doughnut I wanted I said, "Surprise me." She then picked the doughnut that I secretly wanted. I am now convinced she can read minds and she is definitely my favorite employee there. MLIA [/color]
Aug 17 22:00:58 <Dino> [color=teal]...that sounds just like me.[/color]
Aug 17 22:01:00 <Elle> [color=black]Fail. :/[/color]
Aug 17 22:01:02 <Pseudosyne> [color=maroon]Since a lot of MLIAs are just what the person is thinking, like that.[/color]

Aug 17 22:02:06 <Dino> [color=teal]Today, I was fighting with my boyfriend. He wouldn't look me in the eye, so I texted one of my friends saying "He won't look me in the eye. What am I, a basalisk?" I accidentally sent it to him. He told me he loved me for relating our fight to Harry Potter. We made up. MLIA [/color]
Aug 17 22:02:10 <Parabola> [color=navy]Well, seeing as we're both guys...[/color]
Aug 17 22:02:15 <Dino> [color=teal]Who texts their friends in the middle of a fight?[/color]

Aug 17 22:03:05 <PanDzieciak> [color=black]The FML's are clearly much more hilarious.[/color]
Aug 17 22:03:17 <Dino> [color=teal]Kronos...  are you looking for a bish?[/color]
Aug 17 22:03:50 <Kronos> Not at the moment.
Aug 17 22:03:51 <Dino> [color=teal]Pan, LOL.  You must like awkward sex moments.[/color]
Aug 17 22:04:02 <Pseudosyne> [color=maroon]I prefer the MLIAs.[/color]
Aug 17 22:04:07 <PanDzieciak> [color=black]Today, I made one of Rachael Ray's 30 minute meals. It took me 2 hours. MLIA

Aug 17 22:04:08 <Pseudosyne> [color=maroon]I find them less pretentious. :)[/color]
Aug 17 22:04:15 <PanDzieciak> [color=black]No the sex ones are boring.[/color]
Aug 17 22:04:19 <Dino> [color=teal]LOL[/color]
Aug 17 22:04:20 <PanDzieciak> [color=black]But the non-sex ones are interesting.[/color]
Aug 17 22:04:28 <Pseudosyne> [color=maroon]Basically, I associate FML with an ex-friend who I consider a douchebag.[/color]
Aug 17 22:04:29 <Dino> [color=teal]Oh, I forgot you think sex is boring![/color]
Aug 17 22:04:40 <PanDzieciak> [color=black]Oh I see, Pseudosyne[/color]
Aug 17 22:04:41 <Pseudosyne> [color=maroon]And so only if they're really good do I like them.[/color]
Aug 17 22:04:59 <Dino> [color=teal]Pan, your last one goes on FML[/color]
Aug 17 22:04:59 <Elle> [color=black]Today, while entering the building I live in, I walked into my neighbor who winked at me and said last night must have been great. After I asked why, he said he could hear my girlfriend moaning and screaming, and that I must be pretty good at it. I was just coming back from a week overseas. FML[/color]
Aug 17 22:05:24 <PanDzieciak> [color=black]Which one Dino?[/color]
Aug 17 22:05:25 <PanDzieciak> [color=black]Today, I came out of the pub to find a man trying to steal my bike. I said "Hey, that's my bike!" He said, "Oh, sorry mate" and moved onto the next bike. I don't know how to feel. MLIA [/color]

Aug 17 22:13:49 <Dino> [color=teal]"Hi *****.  We have been trying to figure out what, where, and when to do something for Mom's b-day--her 50th. Molly had the lump on her hip removed last Thursday Their are stitches inside but some staples on out side too and she dosen't think those should be there I guess cause she has a couple out-thank God stitches on inside too' I've had to stay right home and keep track of her so she won't get anymore out. Hope to leave her for a real short time tomorrow cause I really need some things at store (bread,toilet paper and milk to name a few). She probably dosen't care as long as I have dog food. I've been sleeping on the couch with her so she wouldn't try to jump up on my bed cause its higher. Dr. didn't want her to jump for a few days--good luck with that!!! I think summer has finally arrived in Maine--been real hot lately. I wouldn't dare complain because I sure did when all we got was rain for days and days. See you soon ******"[/color]

Aug 17 22:31:29 * Elle /me [color=black]shall drop the subject of sex before she gets herself in trouble.[/color]
Aug 17 22:31:30 <Dino> [color=teal]Para!  You said you wouldn't be a princess![/color]
Aug 17 22:31:33 * Shizuka Kawaguchi /me starts to cry, for fucking real, for some reason
Aug 17 22:31:35 <Dino> [color=teal]Who's effing princess are you?![/color]
Aug 17 22:31:40 <Parabola> [color=navy]I'm not.[/color]
Aug 17 22:31:41 <AzricanRepublic> Elle, get your hands out of your pants.
Aug 17 22:31:43 <Sonata> What sex?
Aug 17 22:31:49 <Parabola> [color=navy]I'm someone deluded into THINKING I'm a princess. Slight insanity[/color]
Aug 17 22:31:49 <Sonata> There never was a sex subject.
Aug 17 22:31:53 <Elle> [color=black]This time, they're really not.[/color]
Aug 17 22:31:56 <Elle> [color=black]Lol.[/color]
Aug 17 22:32:01 <AzricanRepublic> "(19:31:53) Elle: This time, they're really not."
Aug 17 22:32:04 <AzricanRepublic> What the f---?
Aug 17 22:32:04 <Dino> [color=teal]Last time, though...[/color]
Aug 17 22:32:13 <Dino> [color=teal]Elle and I...[/color]
Aug 17 22:32:16 <Sonata> I think I'm asexual like Saken.
Aug 17 22:32:21 <Elle> [color=black]What do you think I do when I go away?[/color]
Aug 17 22:32:27 <Shizuka Kawaguchi> ...
Aug 17 22:32:31 * PanDzieciak /me [color=black]thinks hes' asexual like Saken too [/color]
Aug 17 22:32:39 <AzricanRepublic> PD.
Aug 17 22:32:44 <AzricanRepublic> They don't mean they don't like sex.
Aug 17 22:32:46 <PanDzieciak> [color=black]AzricanRepublic.[/color]
Aug 17 22:32:48 <AzricanRepublic> They mean like ...
Aug 17 22:32:52 <AzricanRepublic> "Reproduce by budding".
Aug 17 22:32:54 <Sonata> I had a model naked in my room
Aug 17 22:33:00 <Myth> [color=olive]...you do realize that asexual means don't experience sexual urges?[/color]
Aug 17 22:33:01 <Sonata> Rubbing her breasts before me
Aug 17 22:33:09 <AzricanRepublic> Myth, human asexuality.
Aug 17 22:33:13 <Sonata> She wasn't a model when I met her but she is now
Aug 17 22:33:16 <AzricanRepublic> Not "asexual organisms".
Aug 17 22:33:25 <Sonata> And I had no urges to even touch her
Aug 17 22:33:28 <PanDzieciak> [color=black]Oh.[/color]
Aug 17 22:33:29 <Myth> [color=olive]that's what i'm talking bout, fool! [/color]
Aug 17 22:33:35 <Dino> [color=teal]Sonata...[/color]
Aug 17 22:33:38 * PanDzieciak /me [color=black]sulks in his loneliness[/color]
Aug 17 22:33:39 <Sonata> I just watched and stared like, "Okay"
Aug 17 22:33:43 <Shizuka Kawaguchi> Myth apparently that's not what it means.
Aug 17 22:33:44 <Sonata> So...
Aug 17 22:33:50 <Dino> [color=teal]Go see a doctor...[/color]
Aug 17 22:33:50 <HAL> /channelEnter saranm
Aug 17 22:33:52 <AzricanRepublic> Sonata, there's something wrong with you.
Aug 17 22:33:53 <saranm> [color=gray]Hello[/color]
Aug 17 22:33:53 <Shizuka Kawaguchi> Apparently it means that you experience no sexual attraction to others.
Aug 17 22:34:01 * Shizuka Kawaguchi /me snuggles Pan?
Aug 17 22:34:05 <AzricanRepublic> Of course, there are always woman you don't have an urge to touch.
Aug 17 22:34:16 <Shizuka Kawaguchi> Like the toothless crackwhore on the corner?
Aug 17 22:34:17 <Sonata> I have attraction to people but its never sexual.
Aug 17 22:34:20 <PanDzieciak> [color=black]Hi saranm[/color]
Aug 17 22:34:20 <Parabola> [color=navy]Sonata: You're either asexual, or gay.[/color]
Aug 17 22:34:26 <PanDzieciak> [color=black]Hi Shizuka Kawaguchi[/color]
Aug 17 22:34:28 <Parabola> [color=navy]Or she wasn't attractive, there's that too.[/color]
Aug 17 22:34:30 <saranm> [color=gray]Or your mother... I should hope anyway[/color]
Aug 17 22:34:31 <Myth> [color=olive]sexual urges... sexual attraction... they'e almost the same thing <.<[/color]
Aug 17 22:34:43 <Shizuka Kawaguchi> Myth, not quite.
Aug 17 22:34:45 <Dino> [color=teal]Non sexual attraction?[/color]
Aug 17 22:34:52 <Sonata> She was a dark-skinned beauty Para
Aug 17 22:34:59 <AzricanRepublic> "You have tits, but I like you for different reasons".
Aug 17 22:35:05 <AzricanRepublic> Sonata didn't get jungle fever?
Aug 17 22:35:08 <AzricanRepublic> [i]Awwww[/i].
Aug 17 22:35:11 <Parabola> [color=navy]Hmm, then refer to my above reasons.[/color]
Aug 17 22:35:16 <saranm> [color=gray]Heheh[/color]
Aug 17 22:35:20 * Elle /me [color=black]shall be back in a little while.[/color]
Aug 17 22:35:25 <Myth> [color=olive]yeah, true... i was trying to remember what exactly asexual meant, but the only word i could think of was urges -.-[/color]
Aug 17 22:35:29 <Sonata> I think people know when they're gay
Aug 17 22:35:31 <Shizuka Kawaguchi> Or he just didn't want to fuck her.
Aug 17 22:35:36 <Sonata> Gayness to me is a decision
Aug 17 22:35:37 <Moniker> >.>
Aug 17 22:35:40 <Sonata> Not a mental disorder
Aug 17 22:35:48 * Elle /me [color=black]is not going to do something bad, however![/color]
Aug 17 22:35:56 <saranm> [color=gray]Who thinks gay is a mental disorder?[/color]
Aug 17 22:35:58 <Dino> [color=teal]Elle, LOL[/color]
Aug 17 22:36:20 * PanDzieciak /me [color=black]thinks gayness goes just a tad bit deeper than a decision[/color]
Aug 17 22:36:21 <PanDzieciak> [color=black]Just a tad.[/color]
Aug 17 22:36:22 <Shizuka Kawaguchi> I think flamboyance is a personality disorder.
Aug 17 22:36:25 <Parabola> [color=navy]I think that gayness can happen non-voluntarily. But equally its a conscious decision to accept and embrace it.[/color]
Aug 17 22:36:28 <HAL> /channelEnter [IC]_Viktor_Valentine
Aug 17 22:36:29 <AzricanRepublic> I, on the otherhand, will fuck just about any woman as long as she's attractive to a degree.
Aug 17 22:36:30 <Sonata> Nope.
Aug 17 22:36:35 <Sonata> I've seen people in college who are like
Aug 17 22:36:37 <AzricanRepublic> I guess people are just different, though.
Aug 17 22:36:40 <HAL> /channelLeave [IC]_Viktor_Valentine
Aug 17 22:36:40 <Sonata> I just turned gay last month
Aug 17 22:36:44 <Sonata> And been gay ever since
Aug 17 22:36:56 <AzricanRepublic> I'd kill for PD's asexuality, to be honest.
Aug 17 22:37:07 <Shizuka Kawaguchi> I wouldn't.
Aug 17 22:37:10 <Dino> [color=teal]Really, Az?[/color]
Aug 17 22:37:17 <saranm> [color=gray]I think it's a partial decision, but it's also something your born with[/color]
Aug 17 22:37:18 <PanDzieciak> [color=black]It is pretty nice.[/color]
Aug 17 22:37:23 <PanDzieciak> [color=black]That much less crap to worry about.[/color]
Aug 17 22:37:25 <Shizuka Kawaguchi> I think it would remove a fundamental part of the human condition from me.
Aug 17 22:37:27 <Sonata> You may have a sexual disorder Az
Aug 17 22:37:34 <Sonata> If you want to fuck anything that moves
Aug 17 22:37:37 <PanDzieciak> [color=black]No inferior complexes relating to organ size.[/color]
Aug 17 22:37:50 <AzricanRepublic> Sonata, that's an extreme possiblity.
Aug 17 22:37:53 <AzricanRepublic> Possibility*.
Aug 17 22:37:53 <Shizuka Kawaguchi> I don't have any complexes about my genitalia =P
Aug 17 22:37:55 <saranm> [color=gray]Sonata, thats also called bestiality in some cases[/color]
Aug 17 22:38:04 <Sonata> Asexual people admire the true beauty of a person
Aug 17 22:38:07 <AzricanRepublic> Of course, half of the male population of Americans has a disorder, in that case.
Aug 17 22:38:08 <Moniker> But shagging is so much fun!
Aug 17 22:38:17 * Shizuka Kawaguchi /me fist-bumps Moniker.
Aug 17 22:38:17 <Sonata> Not when your fucking your girl friend's stuffed rabbit
Aug 17 22:38:20 <Shizuka Kawaguchi> Damn right, my man.

Aug 17 22:38:31 <Moniker> Atta girl.
Aug 17 22:38:36 <AzricanRepublic> Having sex is so much fun.
Aug 17 22:38:41 <AzricanRepublic> It's really, [i]really[/i] damn fun.
Aug 17 22:38:44 <AzricanRepublic> ... [i]Really[/i].
Aug 17 22:38:49 * PanDzieciak /me [color=black]disagrees.[/color]
Aug 17 22:38:51 <Moniker> Truth.
Aug 17 22:38:51 * Dino /me [color=teal]agrees.[/color]
Aug 17 22:38:52 <Shizuka Kawaguchi> Up with sexuality.
Aug 17 22:38:57 * PanDzieciak /me [color=black]would rather take out the trash[/color]
Aug 17 22:39:00 <Moniker> It's also a boost in morale. o.o
Aug 17 22:39:00 <PanDzieciak> [color=black]Or attempt to golf.[/color]
Aug 17 22:39:03 <AzricanRepublic> ... No, I mean like, [i]really[/i].
Aug 17 22:39:04 <Shizuka Kawaguchi> Pan : =/ wtf
Aug 17 22:39:04 <Sonata> I think I'd have more fun on a jungle gym
Aug 17 22:39:05 <AzricanRepublic> Golfing sucks.
Aug 17 22:39:08 <Sonata> lmao
Aug 17 22:39:19 <Shizuka Kawaguchi> Sonata you must be having seriously bad sex.
Aug 17 22:39:21 <saranm> [color=gray]So Az... half the American male population enjoys bestiality and is bi?[/color]
Aug 17 22:39:25 <Shizuka Kawaguchi> Don't you masturbate or anything?
Aug 17 22:39:28 * AzricanRepublic /me has done it in a jungle gym.
Aug 17 22:39:34 <Sonata> I'm just too logical for sex
Aug 17 22:39:36 <PanDzieciak> [color=black]My point exactly AzricanRepublic.[/color]
Aug 17 22:39:44 <AzricanRepublic> ._.
Aug 17 22:39:46 <Sonata> I should have been a doctor or biologist
Aug 17 22:39:53 <Parabola> [color=navy]I'm in no position to comment on the subject, to be honest :D[/color]
Aug 17 22:39:57 <AzricanRepublic> And not a stripper?
Aug 17 22:39:59 <saranm> [color=gray]Go doctors![/color]
Aug 17 22:40:00 <Shizuka Kawaguchi> Aren't you like...seventeen?
Aug 17 22:40:03 <Sonata> I really wish a behavioral psychologist
Aug 17 22:40:07 <Sonata> I'm 21
Aug 17 22:40:11 <Dino> [color=teal]Sonata[/color]
Aug 17 22:40:12 <Shizuka Kawaguchi> I always forget who is who

Aug 17 22:40:23 <Dino> [color=teal]Too logical for sex, should have been a biologist?![/color]
Aug 17 22:40:26 <Shizuka Kawaguchi> Sonata's totally going to end up being one of those creepy child-killers.
Aug 17 22:40:32 * Dino /me [color=teal]is a biologist and loves sex![/color]
Aug 17 22:40:33 <AzricanRepublic> ...
Aug 17 22:40:34 <Sonata> lol
Aug 17 22:40:34 <AzricanRepublic> Shhh.
Aug 17 22:40:44 <Sonata> Well, when she showed me her nakedness
Aug 17 22:40:46 * Elle /me [color=black]is back.[/color]
Aug 17 22:40:50 <Shizuka Kawaguchi> All repressed 'n stuff.
Aug 17 22:40:51 * Elle /me [color=black]returns with grapes![/color]
Aug 17 22:40:52 <Sonata> I didn't get off on it
Aug 17 22:40:53 <AzricanRepublic> Sonata, not to sound like an ass or anything, but there's always the possibility your beliefs could change with age.
Aug 17 22:40:59 <Elle> [color=black]...And moisturized hands?[/color]
Aug 17 22:40:59 <Shizuka Kawaguchi> Grapes are nasty.
Aug 17 22:41:00 <Sonata> Except for maybe thinking wow
Aug 17 22:41:03 <Sonata> But that's it
Aug 17 22:41:11 <WorthlessEncounters> [color=orange]W.T.F.[/color]
Aug 17 22:41:12 <Elle> [color=black]...Grapes are good.[/color]
Aug 17 22:41:15 <WorthlessEncounters> [color=orange]O.O[/color]
Aug 17 22:41:15 <Sonata> And when we did screw
Aug 17 22:41:20 <Shizuka Kawaguchi> snrk
Aug 17 22:41:23 <PanDzieciak> [color=black]I don't really see why there is anything wrong with Sonata.[/color]
Aug 17 22:41:25 <PanDzieciak> [color=black]Hi WorthlessEncounters[/color]
Aug 17 22:41:27 <Dino> [color=teal]Sonata, you're probably just a hands-on guy, not a sit-back-and-watch guy.[/color]
Aug 17 22:41:28 <AzricanRepublic> There isn't.
Aug 17 22:41:33 <Sonata> Sex just made me think
Aug 17 22:41:36 <Sonata> This is so stupid
Aug 17 22:41:36 <AzricanRepublic> Everyone seems to believe there is.
Aug 17 22:41:38 <WorthlessEncounters> [color=orange]I always come in at the strangest times lol[/color]
Aug 17 22:41:44 * Shizuka Kawaguchi /me sighs

Aug 17 22:42:12 <Shizuka Kawaguchi> Bullshit.
Aug 17 22:42:14 <AzricanRepublic> Expose thine teats, or remove thyself!
Aug 17 22:42:15 <Elle> [color=black]If you didn't use the word 'titties.'[/color]
Aug 17 22:42:16 <Shizuka Kawaguchi> This isn't even remotely weird.

Aug 17 22:42:52 <AzricanRepublic> Dino, you keep your shirt on.
Aug 17 22:42:54 <AzricanRepublic> At all times.
Aug 17 22:42:58 <AzricanRepublic> Pants too.
Aug 17 22:43:02 * Dino /me [color=teal]pouts.[/color]
Aug 17 22:43:04 <Moniker> How is that mean, Elle?
Aug 17 22:43:10 <Dino> [color=teal]Someone re-install my ego?[/color]
Aug 17 22:43:10 <Sonata> I feel more pleasure holding the person I love. Though I'm not a cuddle whore because holding is like 10-15secs. Sleeping with them, and being close. Getting naked and sex. I would have to be drunk to enjoy it.
Aug 17 22:43:13 <Elle> [color=black]The Cancer comment.[/color]
Aug 17 22:43:15 <Moniker> Its crude, admitedly, but hardly mean.
Aug 17 22:43:16 * PanDzieciak /me [color=black]is all sad and pouty [/color]
Aug 17 22:43:17 <Shizuka Kawaguchi> Apparently I'm not nearly chemically impaired enough right now to show anyone my tits.
Aug 17 22:43:23 <Sonata> Because that way I won't think like, wow this is just...
Aug 17 22:43:26 <Moniker> I said bloody support it! What's wrong with you?
Aug 17 22:43:26 * Elle /me [color=black]holds people in her sleep?[/color]
Aug 17 22:43:29 * PanDzieciak /me [color=black]'s wife said he looks.... sniff...... blind[/color]
Aug 17 22:43:34 <Moniker> Shiz: Work on that.
Aug 17 22:43:42 <Shizuka Kawaguchi> You work on it.
Aug 17 22:43:48 * Elle /me [color=black]hates sleeping alone.[/color]
Aug 17 22:43:55 <Sonata> You know what I KNOW I am
Aug 17 22:43:59 <AzricanRepublic> My fiancee clings to me, literally to my torso, when we share the bed.
Aug 17 22:44:06 * Dino /me [color=teal]sleeps better with company.[/color]
Aug 17 22:44:08 <Moniker> I have booze, you work on that.
Aug 17 22:44:10 <AzricanRepublic> It looks like I have a mass of discolored flesh growing out of my side.
Aug 17 22:44:10 <Sonata> I am definitely sadistic.
Aug 17 22:44:15 <Elle> [color=black]Yes![/color]
Aug 17 22:44:20 <Shizuka Kawaguchi> Moniker, work on getting my ass there.
Aug 17 22:44:24 <PanDzieciak> [color=black]Your fiance's flesh is discolored?[/color]
Aug 17 22:44:25 <Sonata> I need to go get a night job somewhere.
Aug 17 22:44:34 <Dino> [color=teal]Night job?[/color]
Aug 17 22:44:40 <WorthlessEncounters> [color=orange]She would be peesed if she saw you say that, AzricanRepublic. Lol[/color]
Aug 17 22:44:42 <AzricanRepublic> No, my fiancee is a tad paler than me. ._.
Aug 17 22:44:44 <Sonata> Yes. The "night" job.
Aug 17 22:44:49 <Sonata> The job nobody knows about.
Aug 17 22:44:50 <Moniker> I'd think the booze was enough incentive.
Aug 17 22:44:51 <AzricanRepublic> D'ah, I piss her off all the time.
Aug 17 22:44:52 <Moniker> Or the right spelling.
Aug 17 22:45:22 * Dino /me [color=teal]isn't surprised.[/color]
Aug 17 22:45:22 <Sonata> Because as I look back at it
Aug 17 22:45:31 <Shizuka Kawaguchi> I should just.
Aug 17 22:45:33 <Shizuka Kawaguchi> Become a prostitute.
Aug 17 22:45:35 <Dino> [color=teal]What kind of night job?[/color]
Aug 17 22:45:42 <Shizuka Kawaguchi> I mean, good money in it, if you don't mind the work.
Aug 17 22:45:50 <Elle> [color=black]...[/color]
Aug 17 22:45:58 <Dino> [color=teal]I'm reading Sonata and Shiz's posts together...[/color]

Aug 17 22:46:45 <Sonata> And then came the pinching.
Aug 17 22:46:51 <Shizuka Kawaguchi> Pinching?
