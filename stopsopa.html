    <p>RolePlayGateway is offline today, because the US Senate is considering legislation that would certainly kill us forever. The legislation is called the PROTECT IP Act (PIPA), and would put us in legal jeopardy if we linked to a site anywhere online that had any links to copyright infringement.</p>
    
    <p>This would unmake the Web, just as proposed in the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA). We don't want that world. If you don't want it either, visit <a href="http://americancensorship.org">AmericanCensorship.org</a> for instructions on contacting your Senator. The <a href="http://blacklists.eff.org">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> has more information on this and other issues central to your freedom online.</p>
    <p style="float:right;">Thanks,
    <br/>The RolePlayGateway Admins</p>
