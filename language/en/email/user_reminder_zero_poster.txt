Subject: Reminder from "{SITENAME}"! 

Dear {USERNAME},

You registered on {SITENAME} a little while ago. 

We have noticed that to-date you have not yet participated in the community and posted in any of the forums.

Please take some time to have a look at some of our recent topics on {U_BOARD} which you may find interesting to get involved in.

Alternatively, please do not hesitate to start your own topic, even if it is just to introduce yourself to the rest of the community. This is normally the first ice-breaker.
