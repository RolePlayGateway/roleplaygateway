Subject: Deletion of your user account at "{SITENAME}"! 

Dear {USERNAME},

You have received at least two reminders from us in the recent past. 

As there has been no interest/action on your part to participate in any activities at {SITENAME} it has been decided to delete your account from our site.

Please note that your account cannot be recovered should you wish at a later time to join us again. You would need to register a new account at that time.
