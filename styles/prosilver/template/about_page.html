			<h2>About RolePlayGateway</h2>
			<p>We're here to grow and share the roleplaying experience with everyone.</p>
			<p>In what started as a small chatroom, a group of strangers learned about one another through roleplay and chat - and became lifelong friends.  Many years later, some of these friends teamed up to create <strong>RolePlayGateway</strong> (RPG), with the hopes of giving other people that same opportunity to build lifelong relationships that a simple chat room had given them so long ago.</p>
			<p>We <strong>let people advertise their sites</strong>, as we're all about <em>sharing</em> and <em>enjoying</em> the roleplaying experience.  We understand that our site might not be the best place for you, and while we'll work really hard to make sure you have fun here, we'll also be sure to help you find another roleplaying site that fits your style of roleplay.</p>
			<p><strong>We're always open to suggestions and criticism, so give us your feedback, positive or negative.</strong></p>
