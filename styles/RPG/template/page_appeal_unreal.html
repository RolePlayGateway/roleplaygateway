		<p>What is it about a role-playing game that keeps people so utterly interested in its every move? Whether you're playing a single-player or MMO (Massively Multiplayer Online) RPG, you can stay busy forever. And that's what it's all about when it comes to the genre's popularity. There's really no end to an RPG; you can play the vast majority for the rest of your life.</p>

		<p>But it's just a videogame, right; how can it be so appealing? Unlike the slash-and-grab nature of <a href="http://www.casinotop10.net/strategy-articles.shtml">online casino games</a>, or the sporadic action of games on your home-based consoles, text-based RPGs, also known as simply browser-based or PC RPGs, offer a unique experience that becomes more like an alternate life than just a simple pastime. This is an extremely intriguing aspect for millions of people around the globe. It's not so much of an escape as it is a way to experience, in as real of a way as possible, an imaginary world.</p>

		<p>The <a href="//www.roleplaygateway.com/the-multiverse-persistent-world-f4.html">mystical realms and magical planet concept</a> has been with mankind for thousands of years. Unless you really believe jackal-headed creatures roamed ancient Egypt, it's safe to assume that the Egyptians had a vivid imagination when they created the Sphinx, which is a spectacular homage to their God Anubis. The Greeks and Romans brought the spiritual element with their vast assortment of Gods. And not only did their Gods have names and faces, but also incredibly vivid back stories and special powers.</p>

		<p>This theme has continued throughout history. In modern literature, the mystical and magical has been intently explored. In the 20th century, an English author named John Ronald Reuel Tolkien released a series of extremely imaginative and original books with <em>The Hobbit</em>, <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>, and <em>The Silmarillion</em>. After being made into a series of hit movies, almost everyone in the world knows about the LOTR trilogy and the wholly original alternative to modern earth it explores.</p>
		
		<p>Modern technology has made it possible to put an interactive twist on a world that was once reserved to cave drawings, monuments and literature. It's always a great few hours of escape to watch a movie, but to actually participate in the far-fetched alternate reality is an experience that keeps people coming back, time and again.</p>
		
		<p>The <a href="//www.roleplaygateway.com/directory/">RPG</a> genre is strong and getting stronger with every single game release. Entire communities are built around this ever-strengthening niche, and with RPG technology only improving, there's literally no limit to how far these games will go.</p>
