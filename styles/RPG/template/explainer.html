<h3 class="special">Welcome, adventurer.</h3>
<p><strong>RPG</strong> is a community of <!-- over 100,000 --> writers <em>building <a href="/universes">shared universes</a></em>, <em>assembling compelling narratives</em>, and <em>telling incredible stories</em>.  We've been working on these virtual worlds for <a href="/about/">the better part of 20 years</a>, and are excited to begin sharing what we've created — plots to unfold, <abbr title="Not yet unlocked.  Try again later!">quests to complete</abbr>, and <a href="/years-rpg-share-your-story-t98298.html">so much more</a>.</p>
<p>Launching <strong>your hero's journey</strong> is simple.  We'll even guide you along the way!</p>

<!-- <p>Forging worlds is no simple task.  We provide a visual explorer for the text-based worlds authored by our community, and tools for organizing their virtual contents.</p> -->
<!-- <p>There are <abbr title="Not yet unlocked.  Try again later!"><strong>Quests</strong> to complete</abbr>, <a href="/introducing-ink-the-writer-currency-t105820.html">payable in <small>INK</small></a>, so take your time and choose your path wisely.</p> -->
<!-- <p>We're building the world's first decentralized game engine, powered by the expressiveness of human language.  Don't worry if that doesn't make sense just yet, we have a lot more to tell you — so we'll catch you up along the way.  You'll even <a href="/medals">earn some <small>INK</small> for your effort</a>!</p> -->
<!-- <p>We have <abbr title="Not yet unlocked.  Try again later!">a Quest to Complete</abbr>, and <a href="/introducing-ink-the-writer-currency-t105820.html">we pay in <small>INK</small></a>, so go ahead — <strong>take a <abbr title="/look">look</abbr> around!</strong></p> -->
