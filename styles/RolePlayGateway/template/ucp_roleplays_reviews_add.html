The main character(s) are presented in multiple ways (appearance, action, thoughts, speech, etc.). They behave "within" their character. They have a past and a future.</span></div>
					<div><input type="radio" name="characterization" value="Proficient"> <strong>Proficient:</strong> <span>Characters are clear and reasonably developed. The main character(s) have identifiable characteristics. They may seem to lack a past or future.</span></div>
					<div><input type="radio" name="characterization" value="In-Progress"> <strong>In-Progress</strong> <span>Characters are unclear. They may be little more than a name and a description or do not rise beyond stereotype. They may be unbelievably inconsistent, or there may not be enough information to form a judgement about them.</span></div>

					<div><input type="radio" name="plot" value="Advanced"> <strong>Advanced:</strong> <span>What the conflict is in the story is clear and the importance of it to the characters is convincing. Actions will produce new situations which will produce new actions. The characters will struggle with their problems in interesting and meaningful ways. The story will have a satisfying and logical climax that is the culmination of the proceeding events.</span></div>
					<div><input type="radio" name="plot" value="Proficient"> <strong>Proficient:</strong> <span>What the conflict is in the story is clear. The importance of the conflict to the characters may be fuzzy, although it will clearly be important. Actions will produce new situations which will produce new actions. The characters will struggle with their problems. The story will have a climax that is the culmination of the proceeding events.</span></div>
					<div><input type="radio" name="plot" value="In-Progress"> <strong>In-Progress</strong> <span>The conflict may be unclear or absent. The conflict may be clear, but the importance of it to the characters will never be communicated. There may be no actions (the story is static), or the actions do not seem related to an identifiable conflict. The characters may be passive and not struggle. The story may lack a climax that is the culmination of the proceeding events. </span></div>
