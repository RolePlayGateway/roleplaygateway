We've been playing out similar situations before with these new characters and are finally givin' it a go here. Basically just giving an idea of one possibility that the city presents, although consider what happens here something that really takes place in the storyline. And with that, enjoy. ^^ ))<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Edited by Remaeus:</span> This takes place in the <a href="http://www.roleplaygateway.com/overview-t1737.html" class="postlink">city of Veritas</a>, which is, in brief:<br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Strung to pendulum's nib by an onerous fetter dancing to the clockwork of a glaring scarlet star (this of vicious, pulsating rays, stellar torrents, and blasts of heat ever-threatening to shear the current of life from its compass), is a metropolisâ€•a blisteringly hot assembly of alloy cylinders writhing in a torturous embrace. It slinks charily at the cusp of surviving the lethal, flaming titan, finding salvation in an auspiciously refulgent dope reflecting back the conflagration's embrace and apportioning the interior a relatively bearable atmosphere. Created by humankind, Veritas stands as a testament ingenuity as well as blasphemy, hovering just beyond the threshold of a heavenly inferno.</div></blockquote>

		  Another contract to be signed in blood. Affliction preferred the simple jobs, but with simplicity came an underlying shadow of complex tendencies. The job was simple: kill Montana DeVero, the head of the mob family that had recently taken over a nice slice of the city. The shuttle docks for communion travel between the planets was strictly under DeVero's control. Government officials  never spoke out against the obvious criminal organization, knowing what it would ultimately lead to. And so silence was the name of the game. Keep your head low, and your eyes directed to the ground if you don't want to end up being pushed through a wood chipper. <br /><br />However, the complexity of the contract wasn't killing DeVero, but when you kill a DeVero, you pretty much have to kill the entire  family. Affliction was heading straight into the lion's den, but he didn't care. Business was business, god damnit. It was past midnight, and the cold night air whipped like daggers across the form of his body. A lot of &quot;heat&quot; would be needed for this job, and the man knew just where to go: T-Jo's Pawn Shop. <br /><br />The guy had everything from old fashioned Berettas to the modern Tracer Particle Beam Cannons. Despite the advancements in warfare over the past few decades, Affliction preferred old fashioned quality to new age uncertainty. He was to meet his partner for the contract at two in the morning, sharp. Affliction's right arm was slowly raised, the gloved fingers on his left lightly touching the screen on his watch. &quot;It is currently 1:55 A.M.&quot; The robotic monotone voice rang from the small speaker situated on the watch. And so Affliction waited in the cold, ready to get the guns firing and the blood flowing.<br />______________________________

		  The same audible advance broke the night's silence, the consistent patter of two pairs of footsteps traversing sidewalk with a businessman's stride. It wasn't an unusual sight for a place so absolutely repugnant, the consummate professional, the contractor adorned in black, his typical attire masked beneath the evening. A free hand reached up and adjusted the knot of a charcoal tie that complemented the suit while a much more...feminine hand evened out the rest of it, caressing with a deliberately slow and smooth pace that ventured a moment of two against a belt before the man put an immediate stop to that. He was fatigued enough as it is, and a sleepless night no matter what the cause was something unacceptable for one of his profession. <br /><br />The sudden blare of a honking vehicle whipping past the night's silence little cause for concern. There was all manner of 'business' to be conducted as such a preferable hour, although there were certainly none in the industry more apt than these two. Instead would his sight converge on a solitary figure standing outside a familiar establishment, and that businessman would give his most professional grin before approach, steps falling silent. He turned and gave that companion a quick pat on the thigh and a light touch of the lips on the cheek before scooting the broad on her way. There were matters to be handled and such fine merchandise would've been nothin' but trouble for two so focused. <br /><br />He spat on the ground and waited a moment or two. Words weren't necessary when there was a job to complete, and they both knew why they had arrived. Just the sight of being in that city disgusted and comforted him at the same time. Of course he didn't mind indulging in a little after-hours delight back at the 'office', but the retched smell of street scum and beggars proved nothing but frustration, the bastards. If there were enough ammunition in that chamber he'd have put all the sons of bitches out of their misery already, a clean hole precisely worked through every single skull, not a single man left standin'. <br /><br />But he'd have to settle tonight. He'd get his frustrations worked out, that much was certain. It was, as always, just business.

		  Affliction's watch alarm began a procession of loud dings as the time struck two o' clock in the morning, and the man lightly touched the screen twice, turning the obnoxious alarm off. His near frost bitten fingers pulled the black trench coat about his form as if in some vain attempt to completely rid his body of the cold wind that mercilessly pounded against him. He felt flakes of snow cling to his skin and air, and occassionally he would hear a car pass by, or a shuttle fly past overhead. <br /><br />Consequence's steps alerted him to a presence, but Affliction simply smiled in the direction of the vibrations such footfalls would give off. It was a shame their third counterpart was tied up in other affairs on the other side of the city, but such a task would not require the trinity to be linked together in a glorious battle. <br /><br />Affliction advanced to his partner, a light pat against his shoulder in silent greeting. The man was perfectly capable of speech, but chose not to waste words. If he needed to say something, he'd say it. Not to mention the air was so cold, the man was quite positive his tongue would freeze off if it attempted any sort of speech. Consequence was right on time, as always, while Affliction was quite the early bird. It didn't matter anymore, though. They were here, and it was time for a little shopping.

		  A simple nod, useless as it might have been, was all the man would offer before giving another short dusting off on his partner's shoulder, hands working with that professional quickness that signal more than most would ever know. He turned with a kick about on his heel and paced towards their destination with those confident strides yet again. The chill of a frosty evening wasn't much for him. In fact, it set just the atmosphere he would have preferred. There was somethin' about winter and a frigid night that worked well with their kind of obligations and contracts, somethin' about that rush of chill along the veins that was absolutely perfect. <br /><br />Not much matched with calculated murder, but there were always exceptions to generally accepted rules. And what better place to break those rules than in a city so absolutely filthy that fingertips still struggled not to jerk out that 9mm at his side and blast all the bastards to hell. No one would've minded anyways. Would've been quick, a short painless end that would plaster that ivory pavement with an incomparable stain of red. He shook his head and kept walking. It was a business night, after all, as if they weren't all that way. <br /><br />Wouldn't be much longer before they stepped inside a dreary establishment that reeked of gunpowder and rusted iron mingling together with that undeniable scent of alcohol. Another drunk, but one that was fortunate enough to have his life spared tonight.

		  Affliction would listen for his partner's steps, and obliged following them, being led into a store where the same scents met his nostrils. His expression scrunched a bit with disgust, his available senses multiplied ten fold as of such, but discomfort was something he would have to deal with. They needed weapons after all, and even though it'd be easier to just blow T-Jo's brains out and completely rob the store, Affliction stayed his hand. They needed guns, T-Jo would give them guns, and they'd be on there way. <br /><br />Now pay for the guns? These guys don't pay a cent, and the fat gun dealer knows all too well that if he doesn't provide weapons, then his life will be the price he pays. The hitman wasted no time, for adrenaline had already found itself rooted deep within the recesses of his mind, body, and soul. The husky breathing of T-Jo gave off his position, and Affliction, with a diligent stride in his step, journeyed to the counter. <br /><br />&quot;What can I do for yah tonight fellas?&quot; T-Jo blithered like a confused animal caught in a trap, but there yet remained a feeble trace of professionalism in his tone. That alone spared him his life, for Affliction hated dealing with complete pussies. <br /><br />&quot;I want another Enfield. Combustion rounds on this one, and give me two more shrapnel rounds. A fragmentation grenade, and a flash grenade,&quot; The hitman demanded rather than asked, his electric blue eyes staring straight through T-Jo like piercing orbs of lightning. He then extended his left hand to rest on the counter near Consequence, palm turned upwards, which was a silent inquiry for his partner to inform Affliction of his desired weapons and ammunition.

		  Eyes immediately scanned the place despite that familiar haze of smoke that always seem to seep out from their vendor's storage rooms, although he and his partner both knew the reputation of that place. Just like everything within that godforsaken city, it was an absolute trash heap. He wouldn't even venture a guess as to how many streetwhores were in the back indulging in another line or workin' another nightshift. Probably more than the bastard could count. <br /><br />He dusted off that suit, the formal businessman's attire needing to be of the utmost presentation if their first 'transaction' of the night was going to go down without another mess. Fingertips again traced around in his pockets with anticipation before he stepped up to the counter, the clicking of flawlessly clean dress shoes  tapping against an aged floor with a distinct rhythm, not a single click missed, the forewarning of his approach that so many poor sons of bitches heard ringin' in their ears and couldn't do a damn thing about. <br /><br />That hand elevated and fingertips slipped past his belt and emerged swinging around the trigger of a 9mm Beretta, what they preferred to call around his way the 'industry standard'. He tapped the tip down in his partner's outstretched hand for only a moment before bringing it back into that sudden twirling. A single grin shot towards their pathetic shopowner, eyes motioning as if to dare him to take a shot, to try anything without gettin' his fuckin' face splattered all over the walls. There wasn't much time for waiting, and despite his usual patience, this businessman wouldn't take that kind of nonsense tonight. <br /><br />Three short taps on the counter with the Beretta again, and that would be it. Three minutes. If they weren't stocked full by the end of a mere 180 seconds, they'd have to apprehend it by force.

		  Affliction nodded in silent recognition of his partner's request, and he adjusted his rounded shades a bit up the bridge of his nose to once more hide those horrid eyes. &quot;My accomplice here wants three 9mm Berettas, and you have approximately three minutes to get our order filled and the guns in our hands before you find out what the back of your skull looks like,&quot; Affliction said dangerously, his voice and affixed glare over the rims of his shades sending a shock of terror into the store owner. <br /><br />He quietly stammered, &quot;Y-Yes, of course,&quot; and literally tripped into the back. There was some yelling, probably the whore's customers getting pissed at the sudden intrusion. Or perhaps T-Jo tripped in his panic, causing an uproar from spilled cocaine or cheap whiskey. Affliction didn't give a fuck. <br /><br />&quot;Two minutes,&quot; He murmured, his right hand begging its possessor to pull his Enfield Mark II from the clutches of his gun holster and turn the entire store into a battlefield. The hitman ignored such pleas, and his mentality continued counting down the seconds. A minute was left when T-Jo came stumbling out of the back with an armful of guns clutched to his fat and oily chest. The horrified gun dealer gently yet hastily set the weapons and ammunition upon the counter. <br /><br />&quot;Three 9mm Berettas, a combustion round for an Enfield Mark II, an Enfield Mark II, two shrapnel rounds, a fragmentation grenade, and a flash grenade,&quot; T-Jo stammered, sweat pouring down his greasy balding head. Affliction traced the source sound of the guns being placed on the counter, and his sensitive fingers found the Enfield, the rounds, and the grenades. He slipped the revolver into the inside pocket of his trenchcoat, the two grenades were fastened to belt clips on his holster belt, the combustion round was loaded into the new Enfield, and the two shrapnel rounds were stashed into his other trench coat pocket. <br /><br />He left the pistols on the counter for his partner.

		  He tapped his foot incessantly in waiting while one hand rotated that 9mm about an extended fingertip and the other snapped a few times along with that melody which coursed through his head. Somethin' jazzy no doubt, that much was always certain. He worked to that kind of stuff and loved every minute of it, almost like an obsession. But that tune took a quick reprieve when their disgusting proprietor rushed back out with an armful of what they had been waiting ever-so-patiently for. <br /><br />His hands worked with an amazing quickness, a precision that could only belong to someone the underground liked to call the absolute best, a master of his craft and profession and one with an undeniable flair for style and presentation. Fingertips caressed the first pistol and swept it up with an arc, twirling it up and around to find its rest tucked in by his side. He repeated the process without missing a single beat with the last two and finally the one he already began swinging about in his other hand. Sweeping the end of his upper ensemble over the exposed handles, he gave another quick dusting off and felt ready to get the hell outta that unforgiving maggot-infested abyss with the audacity to call itself a damn 'store'. <br /><br />He was surprised he hadn't cringed himself to death the moment he walked in and endless lengths of webs met such a beautiful face. Yeah, he might've been a cocky bastard, but there wasn't a man alive that could scan over his resume and tell him he hadn't reserved the right. A few quick steps brought him back to the door which a single kick threw open. There wasn't room for wasting time and lookin' sharp tonight. They were already late. Straightening his tie with that familiar precision, the man stepped through back into that snowy night, the scent of blood caressing the atmosphere.

		  Affliction listened to the snapping of digits, his partner obviously delving into the vaults of his classical and jazz musical preferences. Affliction was more of a techno guy himself, but respect was given where respect was due. As if out of instinctual necessity, the hitman lightly pushed the shades further up on the bridge of his nose, the small glass barriers sparing the disgusting store owner from the penetrating and empty stare. The footsteps of his partner gave indication that it was far past time to be on their way, and Affliction turned about on his heel, striding towards the door that had suffered a firm boot from his counterpart. <br /><br />A grumble caught his ears. Words weren't there, but the feeling was. Did that fucking pile of shit just grumble at them? Affliction slowly turned as he made it to the doorway, the hard wind whipping through his beautiful onyx locks as he tilted his head down a bit to stare directly at T-Jo. Those eyes transfixed and yet so devoid of life. The pupils nearly completely white and the red veins darting about on the iris like highways in New York City. The store owner cringed with absolute terror as Affliction spoke once more. They would be the last words T-Jo would ever hear. <br /><br />&quot;T-Jo, you forgot to shine my shoes..&quot; The hitman spoke with such sick enjoyment and yet the words themselves might as well have been the bullet. The obese store dealer's fat and clumsy hands didn't even have time to reach for the shotgun under the counter. Bang. <br /><br />Silence, save for the brains and blood along with chips of skull splattering across the rifle rack behind T-Jo. The guy had already pissed himself before his dying body could even naturally eject the wastes. Turns out he was a complete pussy after all. Affliction turned without a second thought, as if he had just crushed a measly cockroach under his boot, slipped the revolver back into its holster, and quietly followed Consequence out the door. Yes, that's right. The consequences of T-Jo's actions brought about his untimely 'affliction', and there would be no salvation for him tonight.<br />______________________________

		  A nice night chill. Yeah, that was absolutely perfect. Somethin' he could work with. <br /><br />The details wouldn't matter, the excursion as brief as it was. Nor did it matter with much relevancy the vehicle they took, who provided it within the dead of evening, nor the fate of that person. All were just minute useless details that would only serve to complicate the simplistic tale weaved by two businessmen performing their civic duty with that undeniable sophistication. <br /><br />The man in the slacks and office ensemble stepped up first with those familiar confident strides that wouldn't miss a single step, the consistent clacking on concrete surface. They were headin' for a more upscale locale, a place with a bit more 'class' or somethin' like that. He stepped through a revolving doorway without muttering a single word or offering a single glance, the stature of an absolute professional just off to another day at the job. <br /><br />This one was another night meeting, and he absolutely hated that shit. In fact, the only thing that frustrated him more than a conference at night was greasy, sleazy, classless mob families. The whole lot of 'em, from the lowest to the highest, he wanted to ruthlessly slaughter. They made his business a hell of a lot tougher, that much was for sure. Why offer those bastards any remorse? They deserved every single shot they got. He'd have chosen rusty knives if preferences were allowed, but this was a contract deal and timeliness was a factor. <br /><br />Stepping through those doors onto polished marble floors, the man immediately arrived with his partner outside an elevator and pressed a single button. More waiting. These guys really knew how to fuck with him, how to try his patience and his tolerance as far as they possibly could. A single audible ding was enough to let the two know their ride had arrived. It was time to get started.

		  The actions were like clockwork. The time was drawing near, and the man simply smiled. He enjoyed his work, but even more so when it was just impossible to stop working. Contract after contract, day after day, bullet after bullet, and death after death. The wind howled in agony. It knew what was going down tonight, and it would accompany the symphony of gunfire and screaming that would dip into a crescendo of magnificent death. <br /><br />Affliction felt the floor change as he followed the steps of his partner into the fancy building. He couldn't see such exquisite luxuries, but the air carried a smell of elegance that downright pissed him off. These sonuva bitches were literally pulling out their ego and wagging it in front of them. You may have class you little pricks, but when you're staring down the barrel of a gun, your class and money ain't gonna get you shit. Affliction's mood held superiority over everything else. One could even say he was quite jolly about the chance at such a contract. Chance? Bullshit. Chance indicates a possibility of failure. They would GIVE them this contract on a silver platter and lick the dirty snow off their shoes. <br /><br />He chuckled as he followed his  accomplice into the elevator, the annoying robotic voice blaring loudly &quot;Ground floor destination reached. Please indicate desired floor destination via voice command please.&quot; Affliction exhaled a bit with annoyance along with the command, &quot;40th floor.&quot; And soon the metallic doors closed, and the elevator gave a subtle jerk as it was sent skywards.

		  Their transport jerked to a sudden stop and metal doors slid open to either side revealing an atmosphere that brought an immediate grin to the businessman's features. It was a party, a nice little classy sorta get-together stocked with the most respected families in their entirety, crooked bosses makin' moves on exquisite waitresses while their wives sat prattling at a table in the corner. <br /><br />It was the kinda thing those high-class condescending motherfuckers put together to keep up appearances and remind themselves how god damn classy they all were. The kind of party where every cigar was lit with a rolled up grand set ablaze, where every other glass of champagne was drugged so they could take a few attendants back to their respective rooms for a little after-hours fun. They were sleaze, complete scum every single one of them. <br /><br />But what truly set the man's heart fluttering was the bustling beat of a jazz melody pervading through that entire party. It seeped through the doorways, that blaring sax and that walking bass, while they were still moving upwards. But the moment those doors opened, for a fleeting instant it hit him full force and set his body into a frenzy that never wanted to leave. <br /><br />Good music and a kill job, now that was a fuckin' night. <br /><br />Even the immediate screams that blasted through the entire room couldn't taint the unadulterated sensuality that the music set. But if there was going to be time to enjoy a bit of the party favors and indulge in a bit of that devil's music, work was going to have to be quick. Both hands slid up along his sides and clutched around a handle. Dual Beretta 9mm Semi-Automatics, the professional's tools. Screams would be plentiful only for a few moments, replaced instead by the consistent blaring crescendo released from gunshot after gunshot. He felt bad for the janitors of the place, but at least they'd be taking care of the first part of the cleaning necessary for the night. There was a little trash that needed to be removed and these two were just the bastards to do it.

		  Affliction's endeavors could surely fill thousands of pages, but actions speak louder than words. Such a classic and sound quote, and yet the source escaped the hitman for the moment. All that mattered now were his marks. His partner wasted no time in unleashing hell upon the unfortunate mob family. The sound of the gun blast was a wonderful euphoric blast of vibrations upon his countenance.<br /><br />Several of the DeVero bodyguards turned over a few tables, drawing pistols from their tuxedo jackets. The sounds of the fancy tables' edges hitting the marble surface echoed within Affliction's mentality. The entire room lit up with vibrations, and the very heartbeats of their victims gave a sure sign that these mother fuckers were scared out of their god damn minds.<br /><br />Time to go to work, Affliction thought, able hands summoning forth one of his Enfield Mark II revolvers. Shrapnel rounds. Basically, each bullet has a timer. When the bullet enters the victim, and the timer counts down, the bullet explodes, sending a few hundred pieces of sharp metal deep into their tissue, muscles, and bones. Think of it like a meat grinder being surgically implanted into your body and then turned on. He had used three bullets already this night, so he had three left. Plenty of ammo to decorate this party with a nice crimson finish.<br /><br />Affliction's right appendage snaked its way into the pocket of his trench coat, drawing the flash grenade from its humble abode. His thumb clicked the timer button, and he tossed the small grenade a few yards from the overturned tables where the bodyguards were struggling to load their pistols. Who the fuck carries a magazine and a pistol separately? Idiots.<br /><br />The grenade rolled the rest of the way, and a blinding light filled the general area, saving his partner from having to deal with such agitations. The bodyguards, as predicted, yelled in shock at the sudden blinding light, and this is when the hitman made his move. He dipped into a swift dash, athletic sneakers grinding into the marble floor as his calves and thighs roared with adrenaline. There were four bodyguards, and three bullets. Affliction loved those odds. The first bullet found a new home within the brain of the bodyguard to his right. The shrapnel ammunition detonated, sending a nice spew of brains and skull all over the bodyguard's blinded partner. The second bullet was fired, finding its way into the ribcage of the second victim. Boom.<br /><br />Pieces of ribs were forced upwards into his lungs and heart. Affliction turned, one bullet left, and two bodyguards left. The third bullet buried into the spine of one of the two guards, a gasping scream escaping him as the shrapnel sent pieces of bone into the face of the second bodyguard. The hitman rushed forward, a firm pistol whip across the jaw sending the remaining DeVero bodyguard to the floor. Affliction's foot raised, and his heel was brought crashing down into the man's throat, completely crushing his windpipe. The blinding light of the flash grenade slowly faded, and he swiftly holstered the revolver, drawing his second. Affliction swiftly ducked down behind one of the overturned tables as two more bodyguards emerged from the backroom, most likely pissed because they couldn't fuck a dirty tramp in peace, and began to fire their pistols at Consequence. Bad move on their part.

		  A momentary reprieve saw a gun-toting hand push the sunglasses upwards serving equal parts comfort and protection from that ungodly flare his partner released with what appeared little regret. Hah, and he thought he was a man more predisposed to the grandeur of flash and explosions, but this shit was gettin' ridiculous. Both pistols emptied into a pile of seven fresh corpses, the businessman clutched both in his right hand and tossed 'em over his shoulder, finding his mark as usual in the trashcan aside the elevator doors while his other hand was already working with that fluency of a specialist, removing another pair with a single yank that sent them airborne, both arms extending to bring those Berettas to their homes, set within the firm grip of their new owner ready to clean house, no pun intended. <br /><br />A single bullet suddenly whipped past his ear, missing by a mere fraction. The unfortunate son of a bitch would've been luckier to have not fired at all. You never disrupt a man who's hard at work, especially not with such a delicate job. His left hand bent at the elbow around behind his back and fired a single shot, splitting the fucker's skull within an instant. He so hated making a big mess, but if they weren't going to let a man get on with his god damn business in peace, then he was going to forcibly silence them. <br /><br />The right followed with yet another shot fired behind him, blasting the next unfortunate bastard that thought he was gonna get a little lucky tonight. He'd have been safer stayin' in the back with his nightly slut. At least then he'd have had a few more moments of pleasure before a jazz mistress belted out his swan song in euphony with a blasting semi-automatic that wouldn't take no for an answer. <br /><br />This wasn't fuckin' amateur hour. It was business time. Both pistols rounded about the front and lay out two of the family they were contracted to bump off in the first place, finally gettin' around to their actual obligations after a little bit of needless interruption. But nothing he wouldn't mind. A quick step and he blasted another, a wife this time. Shame too, the broad looked kinda pretty beneath those flashing lights.

		  Affliction's lips curved skywards as he slowly stood to his feet, turning to survey the complete and utter destruction they had brought about with their endeavors. Most of the family was dead save for the father, Montana DeVero, the big cheese himself, and his two young sons: 20 and 14. Affliction continued to hold that smirk cemented upon his visage, electric blue eyes gazing forward in the general vicinity of the three remaining members of the DeVero family. It was their quickened pace of breath and the severe pounding of their hearts that truly satisfied his ears. Fear. Such a delicious concept. God he loved his job. <br /><br />A bodyguard slowly slid his bleeding form across the marble surface, his entrails attempting to escape the gaping hole the pistol had inflicted upon his countenance. The hitman raised his revolver, and fired one shot into his head. The combustion round exploded, sending pieces of the man's cranium all over the floor. A few pieces of the guard's cerebrum rained down upon the sons, and in their complete panic, they ran directly towards Affliction as if in some vain attempt to get past him. Idiotic fucks. Bang. Bang. <br /><br />The first bullet settled itself inside the younger boy's stomach, sending his guts across the floor. The second round was fired into the throat of the 20 year old son. His entire head was severed cleanly from his body. The lifeless form slumped to the ground, landing on top of the mound of bodies they had created. Montana DeVero merely sat there, jaw dropped nearly to the floor, and his eyes wide in shock in horror. <br /><br />Affliction grinned widely at this, &quot;Looks like the great head of the DeVero family can only sit there and piss himself while his entire family gets killed.&quot; They'd be done with this little business affair soon enough.

		  There was nothing more invigorating than the thrill of the finish, the big finale, that spectacle that they'd work to with a flourish with the utmost professionalism. These bastards were good, the best in fact, and there would be no doubt they could leave when this fact came to light. Most of the ruckus settled down and bodies piling the floor in all manner of erratic shapes and positions, he danced a quick little shuffle to that sweeping jazz tune which flooded the room, arms moving about lost in the rhythms that played. <br /><br />Absolutely nothin' in the world like that jazzed up mingling and blending of a devious big band chorus rising and falling with the belting of a one-woman leader that carried her words with a soothing voice composed of one part angel and the other part devil, that temptress tantalizing and teasing with nothin' but a dirty ballad fixed up in some other time and other place when the world was a little more classy. Each word permeated the entire room, nothing left but the clacking of dress shoes along blood-soaked hardwood floors and that rich enticing voice singin' about the inevitability and unpredictability of that mistress known as love. And there was nothin' that businessman loved more than completing a job and gettin' to turn in for the night. <br /><br />He approached that cowering mob boss, that pathetic waste of the little bit of precious air that still pervaded the city. Stopping, eyes stared down the bastard and sneered with the utmost resentment for everything the man stood for. He was a plague, a plague on his city, a plague on society, a plague on fuckin' humanity itself. A virus that needed to be treated, a problem that needed to be rectified. A sudden click of the tongue worked out, that clear indication to his partner that it was prime time for him to get himself in gear too. <br /><br />Together would arms extend, a series of clicks while pistols worked themselves into place in preparation. He grinned while the voice of his favorite jazz goddess belted out her final note, a blaring climax that rose itself even higher than that which was about to come. Barrel pointed downwards at that corrupt bastard's thick skull, it was time to finish up. <br /><br />A grin, a snap, and the sudden squeezing of two triggers. <br /><br />Bang.

		  Affliction's ears rung with the soothing and yet heightened pace of the jazz crescendo. Arms rasied, guns pointed at the cowering pile of shit before them, and bullets ready to fly through the air and sever the threads of life Montana DeVero had worked so hard to keep secure. His entire family extinguished in one night, and every god damned person in this fucking city would know what went down and who made it go down. This was their city. The governor and politicians? The law? The police? The community? All were puppets being pulled by strings. <br /><br />Affliction grinned, raising the barrel of the gun to his lips, and he gave a short issue of breath upon the smoke ushering forth from the heatened barrel. The Enfield Mark II revolver found its home in the inside of his trench coat once  more. His left hand gently raised, patting his partner on the shoulder, electric blue eyes staring into space. The jazz song ended, and all that took the reigns was a deafening silence. Only momentary however, and how appropriate that a charming classical piece followed. The DeVero's requiem. No longer would their taint wash its dirt over this city. This was merely the first step. Another night would bring another contract, and they would be there to receive every one of them.

		  <strong>OOC:</strong> Anyone from the Multiverse can go to this area. It&#39;s basically a place to chill out and eat, as well as to travel between worlds, and sometimes interesting stuff will happen- after all, ANYONE can come here.<br /><br />To keep some order, I&#39;ve got a squadron of Defenderobos equipped with various weapons. All of them have Hold Rays, Stun Guns, and Snoozedust Launchers. And sometimes there will be some pretty famous and powerful characters here. So don&#39;t even THINK about conquering the place.<br /><br />The Duel Corner can be used to settle any grudges. Many nice utilities for any character, such as Repair Robots and Healing Machines (now capable of maxing your mana!) are present as well.<br /><br /><em>"&quot;Okay, guys, open the gates.&quot; A strange cloaked guy riding on a mechanical bird thing pulled a lever. Instantly, portals from all over the Multiverse opened up. &quot;Now, ready the kitchens! Open up the Duel Corner! Fire up the Repair Robots! Plug in the Wiis! Let&#39;s get this party STARTED!&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Sweet, this place is open!&quot; Tobarr Twohammers jumped out of the portal. &quot;An&#39; looky there! Repairin&#39; constructs that can repair this armor.&quot; Tobarr had no clue what some of these people where, or why they were here, but he knew the place was way ahead of his time. He decided to sit between this weird thing that looked like it had a mushroom on its head and a somewhat large sentient metal construct. Tobarr began to examine the menu, and he overheard the two talking. &quot;Get this. I was over in the Volcanic Depths, at the &quot;Safe Zone&quot;, and the lava was above the &quot;Safe Line&quot;! Safe... right!&quot; &quot;Yeah, well, get this. I was in this old prison, and believe me, I didn&#39;t know what was going on- just that a bunch of Dragons and Titan Golems were appearing out of nowhere! The Mage with me understood it and was actually enjoying the place, but I never want to go there again!&quot; &quot;I&#39;d be guessin&#39; it&#39;s got somethin&#39; fer mages and wizards an&#39; the like.&quot; &quot;Yes, I suppose you&#39;re right, Dwa- oh, there&#39;s my food.&quot;<br /><br />Tobarr would never understand why constructs liked that toxic stuff that was called &quot;Plasma&quot;, but then again, he wasn&#39;t a construct."</em>

She opened her hair an relaxed, all the while the while feeling guilty as her food intake had increased over the past few days of training.

The crowd turned to jeer-and Slannon got pushed into the corner. Immediately the robot charged at him. He leaped out of the way and hit the robot on the back with a jolt of electricity erupting from his hand. In an instant it was over. The robot lay on the ground and Slannon stood there, bewildered.

Casually, ignoring the crowds confused stares, he walked over to a table and ordered his favorite: pure lemon juice mixed with honey.
